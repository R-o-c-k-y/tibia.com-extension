# ‚ÄúEnhance Tibia.com‚Äù browser extension

This browser extension improves the user experience on Tibia.com.

Tibia is a MMORPG I used to play a decade ago, so this script isn‚Äôt really that useful for me anymore (although I hope it is for others). This project started mostly as an excuse to learn how to scrape sites using [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) (see `tools/scrape.js`).

## Installation

* [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tibiacom-enhancer/nffjdandbhengjofneamfibpichapjbb)

## Features

The extension does a couple of things all around the website:

* It skips [the annoying intro page on Tibia.com](https://www.tibia.com/mmorpg/free-multiplayer-online-role-playing-game.php).
* It shows permanent links for news entries and individual forum posts.
* ~~It ensures internal links use HTTPS (i.e. `https://www.tibia.com/‚Ä¶`) rather than HTTP (i.e. `http://www.tibia.com/‚Ä¶`) wherever possible.~~ The Tibia website now does this already, so the extension no longer needs to! üéâ
* On guild info pages ([example](https://www.tibia.com/community/?subtopic=guilds&page=view&world=Vunira&GuildName=Blood%20Moon&onlyshowonline=0)), it makes any guild‚Äôs guildhall name clickable _without_ introducing additional XHR requests.
* On house or guildhall detail pages, it makes sure the URL displayed in the address bar is always a permalink to the building you‚Äôre currently viewing, so that you can always easily copy-paste a permalink to the active page.
* On character bazaar auction detail pages, it simplifies and canonicalizes the URL displayed in the address bar.
* On character bazaar pages, it displays a tooltip showing the cost in EUR when hovering over Tibia Coin prices based on the cheapest store offerings.

The extension enhances character info pages ([example](https://www.tibia.com/community/?subtopic=characters&name=Illja+Mythus)) as follows:

* It adds links to the character‚Äôs PvP history, online time, and experience history as shown on third-party websites.
* It puts the focus on the first link in the character details table, so it‚Äôs easier to move to the other relevant links using keyboard navigation.
* Any character names that are currently online on the same world according to [the ‚ÄúPlayers Online‚Äù page](https://www.tibia.com/community/?subtopic=worlds&order=level_desc&world=Vunira) are highlighted. Also, the level and vocation cells are updated and highlighted if they changed since the character‚Äôs last login.
* It makes the character name easily selectable for copy-pasting ‚Äî just click once on the character name to select it.
* It makes the world name clickable ‚Äî it points to the ‚Äúwho‚Äôs online?‚Äù list for that particular game world.
* It makes house names clickable _without_ introducing additional XHR requests (unlike other, similar extensions). All house IDs are hardcoded into the extension. The link points to the detail page of the house in question.
* It makes sure the URL displayed in the address bar is always a permalink to the character profile you‚Äôre currently viewing, so that you can always easily copy-paste a permalink to the active profile page. (When entering a character name on the website, it performs a `POST` request and the character name isn‚Äôt part of the URL. The extension fixes that too.)
